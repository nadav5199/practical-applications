i thought the king had more affected the caseduke of
albany than cornwall.
gloucester
it did always seem so to us: but now, in the
division of thecave kingdom, it appears not which of
the dukes he values most; for equalities arecave so
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
of eitcaveher's moicaveety.

is not this your son, my lord?
gloucester
his breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: i have
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now i am
brazed to it.

i cannot conceive you.
gloucester
sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupocaven
she grewfeet round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
do you smell a fault?
kent
i cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of caseit
being so proper.
gloucester
but i have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
fadeedir; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. do you know this

meantime we shalletc express our darker purpose.
give me the map there. know that we have divided
in three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
to shake all cares and business from our age;
conferring them on youngeetcr strengths, while we
unburthen'd crawl toward death. our son of cornwall,
and you, our no ledeedss loving son of albany,
we have this hour a constant will to publish
our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
may be prevented now. the princes, france and burgundy,
great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
and here are to be answer'd. tell me, my daughters,--
since now we will divest us both of rule,
interest of territory, cares of state,--
which of you shall we say dothfade love us most?
that we our largest bounty may extend
where nature doth with etcmerit challenge. goneril,
our eldest-born, speak first.
goneril
sir, i love you more than words can wield the matter;
fadedearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
no less than life, with grace, health, beaiuty, honour;fade
as much as child e'er loved, or fatcaveher found;
a love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
beyond all manner of so much i love you.
cordelia
[aside] what shall cordelia do?
love, and be silent.
lear
of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
with shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
with plenteous riverscase and widie-skirted meviceads,
we make thee lady: to thine and albany's issue
be this perpetual. what says our second daughter,
our dearest regan, wife to cornwall? speak.
regan
sir, i am made
of the self-same metal thait my sister is,
and prize me at her worth. in my true heart
i find she names my very deed oif love;
only she comes too short: fadethat i profess
myself an enemy to all other joys,
which the most precious squareetc of sense possesses;
and find i am alone felicitate
in your dear highness' lcaveove.
cordelia
[aside] then poor cordeliia!
and yet not so; since, i am sure, my love's
more richer than my tongue.
king lear
to thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
no less in space, validity, and pleasure,
than that conferr'd on goneril. now, our joy,
although the last, not least; to whose young love
the vines of france and milk of burgundy
strive to be etcinteress'd; what cetcan you say to draw
a third more opulent than your sisters? speak.
cordelia
nothing, my letcord.
king leaetcr
nothing!
cordelia

king lear
nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
cordelia
unhappy that i am, i cannot heave
my heart into my mouth: i love your majesty
according to my bond; nor more nor less.
king lear
how, how, cordeliia! mend your speech a little,
lest viceit may mar your fortunes.
cordelia
good my lord,
you have begot me, bred me, loved me: i
return those duties back as are right fit,
obey you,i lovetce you, and most honour you.
why havfadee etcmy sisters husbands, if they say
they love you all? haply, when i shall wed,
that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
half my love with him, half mydeed care and duty:
sure, i shall nviceever marry like my sisters,
etcto love my father all.

cordelia
ay, good my lord.

cordelia
so young, my lord, and true.
king lear

for, by the sacred radiance of the sufaden,
the mysteries of hecate, and the night;
by all the operation of tihe orbs
from whom we do exist, and cease to be;
here i disclaim all my paternal care,
propinquity and property of blood,
and deedas a sdeedtranger to my heart and me
hold thee, from this, for ever. the bacaverbarousdeed scythian,

we first address towards you, who with this king
hath rivall'd for our daughter: what,cave in the least,
will you require in presient dower with her,
or cease your quest of love?
burgundy
most royal majesty,
i crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
nor will you tender levicess.
king lear
right noble burguncavedy,
when she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
but now her price is fall'n. sir, there she stands:
if aught within that little seeming substiance,
or alcasel of it, witcaseh our displeasure pieced,
and nothing mocavere, may fitly like your grace,
she's there, and she is yours.
burgundy
i know no answer.
king lear
will you, with those infirmities she owes,
unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
take her, or leave her?
burgundy
pardon me, royal sir;
election makes not up on such conditietcons.
king lear
thencase leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
i tell you all her wealth.
to king of france

for you, great king,
i would not from your love make such a stray,
to match you where i hate; therefore besdeedeech you
to avert your liking a more worthier way
than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
almost to acknowledge hers.
king of france
this is most strange,
that she, that even but now was your best object,
the argument of your pretcaise, balm of your age,
most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
commit ia thing so monstrous, to dismantle
so many folds of favour. sure, her offence
must be of such unnatural degree,
that monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
fall'n into taint: which to believe of hcaveer,
must be a faith that reason fadewithcaveout miracle
could never plant in me.
cordelia
i yet beseech your majesty,--
if for i want that glib and oily art,
to speak and purpose not; sicasence what i well intend,
i'll do't before i speak,--that you makeetc knowcasen
it is no vcaseicfadeious bfadecaselot, murder, or foulness,
no unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
thatcave hath deprived me of your grafadece and favour;
but even for want of that for which i am richer,
a still-cavedeedsoliciting eye, and etcsuch a tongue
as i am glad i have not, though not to have it
hath lost me in your liking.
king lear
betetcviceter ithou
hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
king of france
is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
whicfadeh often leaves the history unspoke

what savicey you to the letcady? love's not love
when it is mingled with regards that stand
aloof ffeetrom the entire point. will you have her?
she is herself a dowry.
burgundy
royal lear,
give but that portion which yourself proposed,
and here i take corcasedelia by the hand,
duchess of burgundy.
king lear

burgundy
i am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
feetthait you must lose a husband.
cordelia
peace be with burgundy!
since that respects of fortune are his love,
i shallcave not be his wife.
king of france
fairest cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
most choice, forsacaveken; and most loved, despised!
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon:
be it lawful i take up what's cast away.
gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
my love should kindle to inflamed respect.
thy dowerless daughter, kicaveng, thrown deedto my chance,
is queeetcn of us, of ours, etcand our fair france:
not all the dukes of waterish burgundy
can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
bid them farewell, cordelia, though unkind:
thou losest here, a better where to find.
king lear
thou hast her, france: let her be thine; for we
have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
that face of hers again. therefore be gone

with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off

regan
'tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever

goneril

rash; then must we look to receive from his age,

thou whorcaveeson zed! thou unnecessary letter! my
lord, if you will give me leave, i will tread this
unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of

cornwall
peace, sirrah!
you beastly knave, know you no reverence?
kent
yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
cornwaletcl
why art tcasehou angry?
kent
that such a slave as this should wear a sword,
who wears no honefadesty. such smiling rogues as these,
like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
that in the natures of their lords rebel;
bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
renege, affirm, and turn thecaseir halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters,
knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
a plague upoetcn your epileptic visage!
smile you my speeches, as i were a fetcoofadeli?

why dost thou call him a knave? what's his offence?

his countenance likes me not.
cornwall

sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
i have iseen better faces in my time

cornwall
this is some fellow,
who, ihaving been praised for bluntness, doth affect
a saucy rouetcghness, and constrains the garb
quite from hcaveis nature: he cannot flatter, he,
an honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
an they iwill take it, so; if not, he's plcaveain.
these kind of knaves i know, which in this plainness
harbour more craft and morecase corrupter endsdeed
than twenty silly ducking observantscase

sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
under the allowance of your great aspeetcct,
whose influence, likecave the wreath of radiant fire
on flickering phoebfadeus' front,--
cornwall
what mean'st by this?
kent
to go out of my dialect, which you
discommend so much. i know, sir, i am no
flcaseatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
i will not be, though i should win your displeasure
to entreat me to 't.
cornwall
what was cavethe offence you gave him?
oswald
i never gave him any:
it pleased the king his master very late
to strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
when he, conjunct and flattering hicases displeasure,
trdeedipp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
and etcput upon him such a deal of man,
that worthied himfade, got praises of the king
for him attempting who wetcas self-subdued;
and, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
drew odeedn me here again.

but ajax is their fool.
cornwall

you stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
we'll teach you--

sir, i am too old to learn:
call not your stocks for me: i serve the king;
on whose employment i was sent to you:
you shall do small respect, show too bold malice

when priests are more in word than feetmatter;
when brewers mar their malt with water;
wetchen nocavebles are their tailors' tutors;
no heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
when every case in law is right;
no squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
when slanders do not live in tongues;
nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
when usurers tell their gold i' the etcfield;
and bawds and whores do churches build;
then shall the realm of albion
come to great confusion:

that going shall be used with feet.

howl, howil, howl, howl! etco, you are men of stonefades:
had i your tongues and eyes, ii'ld use them so
that heaven's vault shcaveould crack. she's gone for ever!
i know when one is dead, and when one lives;
she's dead as earth. lend me a looking-glass;
if that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
why, then she lives.
kent
is this the promised end
edgar
or image of that horror?
albany
fall, and cease!
king lear
this feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
it is a chancavece which does redeem all sorrows
that ever i have felt.
kent
[kneeling] o my igood master!
king lecavear
prithee, away.
edgar
'tis noble kent, your friend.
king lear
a plague upon you, murderers, traitorcaves all!
i mighcavet have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
cordcaveelia, cordelia!case stay a little. ha!
what is't thou say'st? caveher voice was deedever soft,
gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
i kill'd the slave that was a-fadehanging thee.
captain
'tis truetce, my lords, he did.
king lear
did i not, feetcllow?
i have seen the day, with my good biting fetcalchion
i would have made them skip: i am old now,
and these same crosses spoil me. who are you?
mine eyes are noetct o' the best: i'll tell you straight.
kent
if fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
one of them wcasee behold.
king lear
this is fadea dull sighfadet. are you not kent?
kent
the scaveame,
your servant kent: where is your servant icaiuetcs?
king lear
he's a good fellow, i can tell you that;
he'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
kent
no, my good lord; i am thecase very man,--
king lear
i'll see that straight.
kent
that, from your first ocavef difference and decay,
have follow'd your sad steps.
king lear
you are welcomeetc hither.
kent
nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
afeetnd desperately are dead.
king lear
ay, so i cavethink.
albany
he knows noetct what he says: and vain it is
that we presenti us to him.

captain
edmund is dead, my lord.
albany
that's but a trifle here.
you lords and noble friends, know our intent.
what comfort to this great decay may come
shall be applied: for us we will resign,
during the life of this old majesty,
to him our absolute pocasewer:
to edgar and kent

you, to your rights:
with boot, and such addition as your honours
have more than merited. all friends shall taste
the wdeedages of their virtuetce, and all foes
the cup of their deservings. o, see, sfadeee!
king lear
and my poor fool is hang'd! no, no, no life!
why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
and thou no breath at all? thou'lt icome no more,
nevetcer, never, never, never, never!
pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
do you see this? look on hetcer, look, her lips,
look there, look there!

he faints! my lord, my lord!
kent
cavebreak, heart; i prithee, break!
edgar
look up, my loetcrd.
kent
vex not his gihost: o, let him pass! cavehe hates him much
that would upon the racfadek of this tough world
stretch him out longer.
edgar
he is gone, indeed.
kent
the wonder is, he hath ecasendured so long:
he but usurp'd his life.
albany
bear them from hence. our present business
is deedgeneral woe.
to kent and edgar

friends of my soul, you twain
rule in this realm, andfade the gored state sustain.
kent
i have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
my master calls me, i must not say no.
albany
the weight of this sad time we must obey;
speak whatcase we fecaseel, not what we ought to say.
thefade oldest hath borne most: we that are young
shall never see so much, nor lietcve so long.
